# Why did you choose this subject? How were you first made aware of it?

We chose to learn React.js in order to build on the concepts introduced in the mini-lesson from several weeks ago.

# What problem does it solve? How does it solve the problem (conceptually)? Why does one use it?

React.js is great for large applications with data that change over time. It aims to simplify the problem of changing data by working only with the VIEW layer (the V in MVC) and building custom HTML "components" to render the data in the DOM.

# What are the alternatives? What is it similar to, if anything?

The alternative would be a templating engine such as Handlebars, which would work just as well—if not better—for a small application. It's hard to compare React to other frameworks, because it's not a full framework, but it kind of combines the VIEW layers of Backbone and Angular, in a way.

# What is the history of this technology? Who built it and why? Who is maintaining it?

React is really new, so it doesn't have much history. Facebook built it and is maintaining it.

# What is your opinion on the technology after having built something with it?



# What are the biggest conceptual hurdles (if any) you encountered when researching this?

# What resources do you recommend for interested students? What article or forum was most helpful to you in learning this?


# What are 3 interview questions one might be asked about this technology?
